# Project Title - Astrono-MyDashboard

## Project Description:
Using available open astronomy and NASA APIs, we will build a simple dashboard that will use location data to pinpoint the night sky and any astonomical events which are upcoming, such as:
- Lunar Eclipses
- Meteor Showers
- Planetary locations
- Moon/planet rising & setting
- and many more!

## User Story

As a USER, I want a dashboard to provide interesting or notable celestial events happening in my area. I can also select a celestial body (Star, planet, constellation) and a map will centre and information about that body will be displayed.
